        Snacks in a Van is new startup company operating
        in Melbourne. Snacks in a Van runs a fleet of food
        trucks that work as popup cafes. Our vendors drive
        around Melbourne, parking wherever they think
        there are customers. They have no fixed schedule
        and are mobile and flexible. Some vendors tend to
        go to the same places each day, while others are
        more random, or try to park near big events like
        sporting matches and university open days.
